## Intro

MLB Game Tracker is a MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) project with D3.js for visualizations. This is a project that is many years coming. The inspiration came from a great baseball analytics book called The Book: Playing the Percentages in Baseball. This book covers many topics that are mostly understood by people that follow baseball. Ideas like bunting is almost always a bad idea (same with steals), hot streaks aren't really a thing (neither are cold streaks) and even goes into optimizing your lineup (guess what? The cleanup hitter isn't as important as your little league coach thought). 

Ultimately my goal will be to create a view that allows users to track what the expected runs are for each team compared to the actual number of runs scored. And to give a view into the win probability for each team throughout a game.
