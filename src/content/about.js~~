  I am a Software Engineer with a wide variety of technology experience
        from data analytics and data science to sales operations consulting.
        Throughout my career, I have always found the most satisfaction when I
        was building something with code, so I left my consulting job behind and
        to take on Software Engineering. Due to the nature of my background, I
        know the level of involvement needed for a successful software project.
        I'm excited to join a Software Engineering team that constantly
        challenges itself to build the best tool possible.
